                Rake
                was sweating. That was how he knew he was going to die. From birth,
                it was a lesson drilled into everyone, every day. Never go
                overdressed into the cold, and never overexert yourself. If you start
                sweating, it will freeze your clothes, they’d said. If your clothes
                freeze, so too will you. And if you freeze, you will die.

                And
                so, Rake was dying. It was the simple, hard, freezing cold truth.
                He’d been warned, again and again, that to attempt what he had was
                foolish, childish and stubborn. But the Rite of Age was sacred, as
                was the right of each Citizen-To-Be to choose their Rite. The rules
                governing the Rites were vague and amorphous—intentionally so. In
                order to become a Citizen, a Citizen-To-Be was expected to exercise
                creativity, judgment and ingenuity. That wasn’t to say that every
                Rite was a one-of-a-kind journey, entirely unique in and of itself.
                Nobody would every say it aloud of course, but there were the
                standard Rites that were perfectly acceptable. Leaving the Community
                to find a functional piece of technica was considered a prestigious,
                if uncreative Rite. No one would think less of you for it, but it
                would win you neither notoriety nor prestige.

                Rake,
                of course, had never even considered a “standard” Rite. For him,
                forgettable normality was as bad as the shame of failure. He intended
                to return famous and heroic or not at all. Unfortunately for his
                visions of fame and prestige—to say nothing of his continued
                existence on this mortal coil—it would appear that he would be
                doing the latter.

                He
                lay in the snow wishing, in this time of weakness and encroaching
                death that he had instead opted for one the safer, simpler Rites.
                Anything that would stave off the horrible burning cold, and worse,
                the encroaching numbness. He had long since lost most of the feeling
                in his fingers, and he feared frostbite would be setting in soon. Not
                that it would be an issue for very long. He was lost in the middle of
                a snowstorm, with no sense of where he was, or from where he’d
                come. His supplies were exhausted, and his tent had been lost in a
                moment’s inattention when he’d set it down, and it had rolled
                into a crevasse hidden by a thin layer of snow. Now as a direct
                result of his hubris and overconfidence, he was shivering in the
                meager shelter provided by a snowdrift, laying on his side and hoping
                for a miracle.

                He
                never actually expected one, which was why it took him a moment to
                react to the flashing of the white fire in the distance. He blinked
                twice, before lifting his head up. Clumps of snow fell from his hair
                and thumped softly into the drift beneath him. When the tiny white
                speck of illumination failed to disappear as hypothermia-born
                hallucinations are wont to do, he climbed to his knees. As he did,
                tendons creaked and bones popped, the deadly chill stiffening them
                and rendering them unresponsive. The flickering light continued to
                exist, even as Rake blinked the crusted flakes away from his
                eyelashes.

                He
                stumbled forward, the fatal frost lining his coat sleeves and pant
                legs hindering his movements. He fell to his knees, and began
                crawling. His head dipped, as he lacked the strength to hold it
                upright. He fell into a rhythm, knowing that if he stopped, he would
                never start again. Right hand and left knee forward, gasp for breath.
                Left hand, right knee forward, repeat. Over and over again until
                finally, his head bumped into something hard and unyielding. With a
                supreme effort of will, he lifted his head to see what his struggles
                had brought him before. He was met with a solid, flat wall of white
                snow. In places, the snow had fallen away to reveal a dull silver,
                pitted and cracked in places, but still sound. Further above still,
                was the white fire he had seen before. Except…it wasn’t fire. It
                blinked steadily, eight feet above Rake’s head. On for a few
                seconds, then off for another few. Over and over again. The fire
                neither wavered nor burned, if the snow encrusted around it was any
                indication. In fact, as Rake squinted more closely, it was contained
                within a strangely shaped glass bulb.

                Rake
                realized that the pulsing of the white light had him hypnotized, and
                slowly shook his head. As he did so, his forehead brushed the wall in
                front of him, and scraped a bit of snow away, revealing more of the
                dull silver surface. This caused a mini-avalanche, and more ice fell
                away from the wall in a snaking chain leading up from the base. Once
                the powder settled, Rake looked up again, and discovered that there
                was a small square protruding from the wall above him. It jutted out
                about a quarter-inch from the wall, and was covered with a small
                metal plate that was gently clacking against the wall in the wind.

                Rake
                hauled himself to his feet by bracing his shoulders against the wall
                and slowly using his knees, and then his legs to lever himself
                upward. Once he was in an approximately standing position, he paused
                for a second, panting, before glancing at the square protrusion.

                The cover was still tapping against the wall. Rake shrugged, and
                lifted it experimentally. The snow caked in between the hinges caused
                it to jam halfway, but Rake persevered and eventually lifted it to a
                full ninety degrees from the wall and peered underneath. There was
                nothing but the shape of a handprint outlined in black glass,
                crisscrossed with a grid of thin white lines. Rake blinked
                unsteadily, then pushed his right palm firmly against the handprint,
                matching his hand’s position to the print’s as best he could.

                a moment, nothing happened. And then, there was a barely perceptible
                tremble that ran through the wall, and the panel beneath Rake’s
                hand suddenly warmed. His eyes slowly widened, and by the time he
                thought to jerk his hand away, the heat had disappeared again. He
                frowned, and left his hand where it was, savoring the fading remnants
                of the warmth.

                the endless expanse of blowing white. But when he turned back, he
                found that an otherwise unremarkable rectangular section of the
                building in front of him had depressed. Before his eyes, the section
                of the wall lifted out of sight, leaving a perfectly rectangular
                doorway leading into dimness. Without waiting to think, Rake stumbled
                forward into the relative safety of the darkness. The door slammed
                shut behind him, leaving him in sudden darkness and silence. His
                breathing was cacophonous in his ears, and just as it occurred to him
                that this may have been a very bad idea, a single light above him
                flickered on. Then another. And then in a rush, the entire ceiling
                became a mess of dim, flickering bulbs like the one he’d seen
                outside. The room trembled, and he head a distant, muffled

                narrowly avoiding jumping in surprise this time, but his eyes widened
                as a translucent wall of white appeared in front of him and began to
                slowly approach him. Rake backed up slowly, and suddenly found that
                his back was to the wall he’d entered from. He turned, and tried to
                find a panel like the one outside that would let him out, but no
                amount of scrabbling uncovered anything. He looked back and the
                advancing wall of white was nearly upon him. He curled up against the
                wall as tight as he could get, and crushed his eyes shut. The humming
                grew louder and louder, and then it was right on top of him. Any
                second now the white was going to crush him or vaporize him the way

                waited, counting his breaths. One…two…three…four? The humming

                surprise that the wall of white was receding. He blinked and looked
                down at himself. He felt fine. In fact…he felt more than fine. It
                took him a moment to figure out what was wrong, but when he did, his
                eyes shot wide open with surprise. All the snow that had been frozen
                onto his skin and clothing was gone! There was no trace of it. In

                peered around cautiously, waiting for any further apparitions to
                appear. When none did after several minutes, he started forward, wary
                of his surroundings. When he passed through the doorway, it shut
                behind him with an echoing clang. He jumped, but knew better than to
                look behind him at this point. Ahead of him was a long, rectangular
                hall. He had never seen anything like it; the walls were perfectly
                perpendicular to the ground and ceiling. The walls were made of a
                duller, less-reflective metal than the previous chamber had been, and
                the ground was a hard, dust-covered, polished stone. Rake’s
                footsteps echoed between the two perfectly-straight walls, and left
                footprints in the dust.

                As
                a tiny, tinkling sound came from above, Rake looked up just in time
                to be blinded by a flash of white fire-light. He gasped, and jerked
                his head away, rubbing the blindness out of his eyes. He looked up
                and found whitefires flaring up along the length of the hallway,
                flickering into a steady, sterile illumination. Rake simply stared
                for a moment, attempting to comprehend just what it was that he had
                discovered. This was made more difficult by a number of things,
                including the increasing pain in his extremities. He grit his teeth
                as blood flow began to return to his fingers and toes, and his head
                began to pound. His vision swam and he found himself sitting on the
                ground, against a wall with no recollection of moving there.

                he looked back the way he’d come. As he expected, there was no sign
                of the doorway. He turned to look ahead, took a second deep breath
                and began moving forward. Above his head, the white lights ebbed on
                and off in sequence, beckoning.

                leaned with one hand trailing against the right wall, seeking with

                protrusions and began to recognize what must have been the
                microscopic gaps between the walls and doors that slid noiselessly
